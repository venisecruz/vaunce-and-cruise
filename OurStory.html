<center><h1>Our Story</h1></center><br><br>
<p align="center">Vaunce & Cruise Cosmetics started life in Sta. Mesa, Manila. At first, <br>they made the cosmetics in their kitchen and sold them straight from the salon to fellow makeup artists,<br> as well as models and photographers. Soon, stylists and fashion editors got in on the action. <br>As the magazine credits racked up and word-of-mouth popularity grew, <br>the duo launched V&amp;C in March 2017 from a counter in a Manila department store.<br><br><br>

The store took the industry by storm, offering a wide range of products that<br> blended street savvy with glamorous style and panache. Behind the counter, the V&amp;C approach<br>was notably different. Rather than driving sales through traditional promotional techniques, V&amp;C relied on <br>the integrity of its carefully formulated product line. Adding to the image was a touch of outrageousness. <br>A company that honours individuality and self-expression above all else, it brought a <br>brilliant sense of drag and theatre into the sleek V&amp;C stores and department store counters.<br><br><br>

Venise Cruz was inspired to create Vaunce & Cruise Cosmetics after years <br>of experimenting with the best-of-the-best in beauty—and still seeing a void in the industry <br>for products that performed across all skin types and tones. She launched a makeup line <br>“so that women everywhere would be included,” focusing on a wide range of traditionally <br>hard-to-match skin tones, creating formulas that work for all skin types, <br>and pinpointing universal shades.<br><br><br>

V&amp;C products are designed to feel lightweight, even as they <br>deliver buildable coverage that effortlessly layers, to ultimately “make skin look like skin.”<br> Most importantly, Venise creates makeup to inspire: “Makeup is there for you to have fun with,” she says. <br>“It should never feel like pressure. It should never feel like a uniform. Feel free to take chances, and take risks, <br>and dare to do something new or different.”</p>
